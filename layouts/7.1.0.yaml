# Immersive audio 7.1.0 Speaker Layout
# ITU-R BS.2051-3 Configuration 4+5+0
#
# This is a common immersive home theater layout with:
# - 7.1 bed layer (8 speakers including LFE)
# - 4 height speakers at 45° elevation
#
# Total: 12 channels (including LFE)
#
# Coordinate system:
#   Azimuth:   0° = front, -90° = left, 90° = right, ±180° = rear
#   Elevation: 0° = horizontal, 90° = zenith, -90° = nadir
